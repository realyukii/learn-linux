A demonstration on how to run Linux kernel in QEMU with busybox as its
user-space applications.

Pre-requisites:
- pre-compiled Linux kernel inside `smol_playground`
- pre-compiled statically-linked busybox
- kernel module `9pnet_virtio` (optional for host-guest shared directory)

You MUST bootstrap the `smol_playground/initramfs` by installing busybox into it.

Since we use custom `init` file, you can safely remove `linuxrc` that get 
generated after installing busybox.

Install the `9pnet_virtio` kernel module into `initramfs/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/`.

After everything has been set up, you can simply run `./start_vm.sh`.
