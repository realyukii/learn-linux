Busybox source code in git repository:

Current busybox compilation issue can be solved by disable CONFIG_TC 
in `.config` file:
- https://forum.beagleboard.org/t/errors-during-busybox-compilation/38969/6

`modprobe` provided by busybox seems to expect kernel module file in 
decompressed form.

Shared folder require `CONFIG_NET_9P_VIRTIO=1` in `/proc/config.gz`, this
can be satisfied by loading `9pnet_virtio` kernel module.
